# Interactive Design Patterns and SOLID Principles Showcase

## Introduction

Welcome to the Interactive Design Patterns and SOLID Principles Showcase! This repository provides a visually engaging and interactive educational experience for learning about common Software Design Patterns and SOLID principles. Each concept is presented in its own self-contained HTML file with interactive demonstrations, inspired by visual algorithm learning repositories.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to any principle or pattern directory
3. Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser
4. Interact with the examples to explore and understand the concepts
5. No server setup required - all demos are self-contained HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Structure Overview

This repository is organized into two main sections:

- **SOLID Principles**: Demonstrates the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design
- **Design Patterns**: Showcases the most common design patterns categorized as Creational, Structural, and Behavioral
