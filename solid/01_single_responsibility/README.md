# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## Definition
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.

## Problem
When a class has multiple responsibilities, changes to one responsibility may affect others, leading to tight coupling, increased complexity, and difficulty in maintenance.

## Solution
Split classes with multiple responsibilities into separate classes, each handling a single concern.

## Core Idea
A class should focus on doing one thing well and doing it completely rather than trying to accomplish multiple tasks.

## Benefits
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Less side effects when changes are made
- Improved testability
- Better reusability
- Reduced coupling
