# Logo Assets

This directory contains the logo assets for the Algorithms & Data Structures website.

## Files

- `logo.svg` - Vector version of the logo, ideal for web usage
- `logo.png` - Bitmap version of the logo (to be generated from the SVG)

## Logo Description

The logo represents core concepts in algorithms and data structures with an elegant, professional design:

- A binary tree structure with refined nodes and connections
- An array representation at the bottom
- Transparent background with subtle gradient-styled elements
- Professional styling with subtle shadows and refined proportions

## Design Elements

- **Nodes:** White/light gray gradient with blue-purple gradient outlines
- **Connections:** Smooth blue-purple gradient lines with rounded caps
- **Array Cells:** Rounded rectangles with the same styling as nodes
- **Shadow Effects:** Subtle drop shadows for depth and professionalism

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the SVG version whenever possible for better quality at any size
- The transparent background makes it suitable for both light and dark contexts
- Maintain the aspect ratio when resizing
- The minimum recommended size is 40px x 40px

## Generating PNG from SVG

To generate the PNG version from the SVG:

1. Use a tool like Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, or GIMP
2. Alternatively, use online converters like [SVG to PNG Converter](https://svgtopng.com/)
3. For command line usage, tools like ImageMagick can be used:
   ```
   convert -background none assets/logo.svg assets/logo.png
   ```
4. Important: Make sure to preserve transparency when converting to PNG

## Colors

The logo uses a gradient with these colors:
- Start: #3498db (Blue)
- End: #9b59b6 (Purple)

These colors complement the website's design and represent the flow between different algorithmic concepts.
