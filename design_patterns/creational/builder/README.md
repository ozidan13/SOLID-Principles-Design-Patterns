# Builder Pattern

## Intent
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

## Problem
How to create a complex object with numerous parts that must be created in a specific order or sequence.

## Solution
The Builder pattern suggests extracting the object construction code out of its own class and moving it to separate objects called builders. The pattern organizes object construction into a set of steps that can be called independently and in different sequences.

## Key Participants
- **Builder**: Specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object
- **ConcreteBuilder**: Constructs and assembles parts of the product, Implements the Builder interface
- **Director**: Constructs an object using the Builder interface
- **Product**: Represents the complex object being built

## Applicability
Use the Builder pattern when:
- The algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled
- The construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed
- You need to build objects that require multiple steps to set up correctly
- You want to create a complex object with clear setup steps

## Benefits
- Allows variation of a product's internal representation
- Isolates code for construction and representation
- Gives finer control over the construction process
- Simplifies creation of complex objects
