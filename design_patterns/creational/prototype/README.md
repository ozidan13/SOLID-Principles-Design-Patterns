# Prototype Pattern

## Intent
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

## Problem
How to create objects when creating them directly is either expensive, complex, or both, especially when the system should be independent of how its products are created.

## Solution
The Prototype pattern involves implementing a prototype interface that tells an object to create a copy of the current object. This is done by creating a copy constructor or clone method.

## Key Participants
- **Prototype**: Declares an interface for cloning itself
- **ConcretePrototype**: Implements the clone operation
- **Client**: Creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itself

## Applicability
Use the Prototype pattern when:
- The classes to instantiate are specified at run-time
- You need to avoid building a class hierarchy of factories that parallels the class hierarchy of products
- Instances of a class can have one of only a few different combinations of state
- Creating an object directly is expensive or complex

## Benefits
- Reduces subclassing
- Adds and removes products at runtime
- Specifies new objects by varying values
- Configures an application with classes dynamically
- Helps when creating many identical objects
